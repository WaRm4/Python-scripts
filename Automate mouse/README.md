# Automating mouse scripts

Feel free to change the variable in the files, for example to change the key to quit the script.


For both of these scripts, you will need to install both mouse and keyboard libraries.

# AutoMouseClicker

This one is useful to click very quickly several times without touching your mouse. 


You can try it on a click speed test like [cpstest.org](https://cpstest.org/).

You can adjust the variable **"delay"** to click slower or faster.


Get in mind that if the delay is too small, it might be too fast for the website or game or whatever it is, to handle this much click per seconds.


With a delay set to 0.001 I was able to get approximately 64.8 clicks per seconds, and I tried to lower the delay but it didn't improve the click speed. 

# AutoMousePresser

This one main utility is for the game **Minecraft**. For example when you have a cobblestone generator but you don't want to keep pressing your mouse left click.


Tip : If you're playing on a version that handle the "InventoryTweaks" mod, use it to automatically switch your broke tool ;)
