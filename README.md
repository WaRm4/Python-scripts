# Python-scripts
A set of useful (or not) Python scripts created by myself.

# Requirements
- You need to have a proper installation of Python 3
You can download it [there](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- You might also need to install some libraries using "pip" for example
You can download it [there](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

# Troubleshooting

I created those scripts on Windows using Python 3.9.
You might get some errors if you try running it on other version of Python or maybe on other OS.
